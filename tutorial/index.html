    <title>OAuth2 Github Login and API Example in Play</title>

    <h2>Play, GitHub and OAuth2</h2>

    <p>
        This template covers the use of OAuth2 to authenticate yourself into a play application,
        and furthermore using the OAuth2 credentials to access the github api.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you can use this template successfully, you will need to configure the necessary
        github api key in github, and then restart activator with the api key and secret in your
        environment so that the play configuration can pick it up. See the next page of the
        tutorial for step-by-step instructions for doing that.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting up Github API Keys</h2>
    <p>
        First, log in to your github account from your browser, and then follow these instructions
        to prepare for this demo.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Use the cog icon at the top right of the github main page to access your settings.</li>
        <li>Choose <b>Applications</b> from the left settings navigation panel.</li>
        <li>Under Developer Applications at the top, hit the "Register new application" button.</li>
        <li>Fill in the form, suggested values are:
            <ul>
               <li><b>Application Name:</b> Play OAuth2 Scala Sample (Testing) - Testing is added
               because in the real world you would tend to have one app registered for development
               and testing, and another with different API keys for production.</li>
               <li><b>Homepage URL:</b> Some URL to a site you own or maintain. In real usage
               this would be the home page URL of your web application. If you really have nothing
               to put here, just make something up like http://nothingheretesting.com</li>
               <li><b>Application Description:</b> An example of using OAuth2 for login authorization and API access in Play and Scala.</li>
               <li><b>Authorization callback URL</b> http://localhost:9000/_oauth-callback</li>
            </ul>
            it's important to use the exact Authorization callback URL given here, as this corresponds
            to the correct URL to redirect to after successful login for running this application on
            your local machine. For a real application, this would redirect back to the _oauth-callback
            URL on the real web application (hence the need for a separate one for development/testing).
        </li>
        <li>Now hit the <b>Register Application</b> button</li>
        <li>On the success page, write down or copy your Client ID and Client Secret fields somewhere,
        as you will need these to make the rest of the demo work.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Re-run the Demo with Keys</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you have the client ID and secret keys, you need to re-run
        activator with those settings available. There are various ways you
        can do this (like putting them into your environment variables and
        logging out and in), but the easiest is to stop activator, then
        re-run it as
    </p>
        
        <pre><code>
GITHUB_AUTH_ID=*CLIENT_ID* GITHUB_AUTH_SECRET=*CLIENT_SECRET* activator ui
        </code></pre>
    <p>
        replacing *CLIENT_ID* and *CLIENT_SECRET* with the values provided
        by github for your application. All of this command should be on one
        line so that the environment variables apply to this run of activator.
    </p>
    <p>
        To run the demo and make sure it now works, select Run in activator
        and then hit <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a>.
        You should see a message to login with github, hit that link and
        you will either go to a github login dialog to fill out, or
        if you are already signed in to github, you will be immediately taken
        to a page listing details about your github projects. If you are not
        logged in to github you will be taken to that details page after
        successful login.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that OAuth2 doesn't make you log in to a github session if
        you are already logged in to that session. It picks up that
        existing authentication and uses it to prove that you are you.
        This makes it a very nice user experience for someone using
        credentials that they have already authenticated in this browser
        session.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to see the flow with the login page, using another
        browser tab, log out of your github session and then try using
        this app again, you will go through the whole flow, including login.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's take a look at the code and the OAuth2 flow.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>OAuth2 Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        First let's take a look at the
        <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>
        configuration settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The important lines are at the bottom of this file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
github.client.id=${GITHUB_AUTH_ID}
github.client.secret=${GITHUB_AUTH_SECRET}

github.redirect.url="https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=%s&redirect_uri=%s&scope=%s&state=%s"
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The first two use those client ID and secret values we provided to activator when
        we re-ran it, and the third is the github authorization URL which will be filled in
        with the id and secret, as well as a redirect uri field and a state, more on those later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, let's look at the
        <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file.
        which has the following lines of interest:
    </p>
    <pre><code>GET        /_oauth-callback        util.OAuth2.callback(code: Option[String], state: Option[String])
GET        /_oauth-success         util.OAuth2.success</code></pre>
    <p>
        The first defines a callback URL that oauth2 will use to confirm that the user
        has been authenticated. You will notice that this is the same URL we put into
        the callback field when registering our application on github. The two fields, code
        and scope, are filled in by github on the callback and we will see what these do
        later in the tutorial. They are optional because we are also going to use
        play to provide this callback URL through the routes lookup and don't have codes to
        use when getting that. The second route is just a page that we will go to once the
        callback is successful, and that page will list all github project details.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Redirecting to/from Github Auth</h2>
    <p>
        When you first hit the app, the routes file sends you to the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">index method in the
        Application controller</a>. This first constructs an instance of the OAuth2 class using
        the application configuration.
    </p>
    <p>Next it gets the callback URL from the routes file with
    <code>util.routes.OAuth2.callback(None, None).absoluteURL()</code>. The two
    Nones for the optional fields are just to give defaults - we don't want parameters
    in the URL, just the URL itself to redirect back to.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>val scope="repo"</code> is a field that github uses, in this case it means
        request access to the repo scope so that we can perform api operations against the repo.
    </p>
    <p>
        The state on the next line is a randomly generated UUID. This will be used to ensure
        that the call back from github matches our random UUID and make sure someone else isn't
        doing something bad to try and get into our site. It's up to us to check the returned
        code and make sure it matches this one upon handling the callback.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we construct the big uber URL which will call github with our redirect, scope and
        random UUID. That URL is then passed into the index page, and at the same time we store
        the random UUID in our session so that we can check against it when the callback comes.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index page</a> the passed in URL
        is used to send the user to github, where the authentication will occur.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Handling the callback</h2>
    <p>
        Once the user clicks on the github URL from the index page, github takes over. It may
        be that the user is already logged in to github, in which case github immediately
        calls back to our own redirect with the necessary fields. If not, the user will be
        prompted to log in to github, after which the same callback URL back to us will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the callback does come, the routes file pushes it to the
        <a href="#code/app/util/OAuth2.scala" class="shortcut">callback method in util.OAuth2</a>
        which takes the optional fields <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. With a
        successful callback from github, these will both be there, but we should protect against
        them not being, which is why the whole method is protected in a for comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assuming the code and state are present, the method then checks that the returned state
        is the same as that stored in our session, if not, that constitutes an authorization
        failure and probably indicates someone is doing something bad. If it matches, the
        <code>code</code> is then used to communicate back to github to acquire an API token
        for this session that we can use to make API calls. This token will be different
        on each successful authentication against github, which protects github itself from
        spoofing attacks. The code to obtain the github token by using this code can be seen
        in the
        <a href="#code/app/util/OAuth2.scala" class="shortcut">getToken method in the OAuth2 class</a>.
        Compared with the rest of the OAuth2 handshake, getting a token using a code is pretty
        straightforward and should be clear from examining the getToken method. Once the
        token is obtained, it is put into the session and the success page called (back in the
        callback method).
    </p>
    <p>
        If any of these steps fail (i.e. missing parameters, state not matching, etc.), then
        authentication failures or bad request messages are generated. There is only one
        happy path through this function, and that's when the code and state are returned and
        the state matches that expected, and the token can be obtained successfully.
    </p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Success, at Last!</h2>
    <p>
        Finally let's take a look at the
        <a href="#code/app/util/OAuth2.scala" class="shortcut">success method in the OAuth2 object</a>.
        This is deliberately super-simple, since the aim of the tutorial is to show you how to
        successfully negotiate an OAuth2 connection, but anyway, this method just calls the github
        API rest URL to get the repo details. To do so, it requests the oauth-token we stored
        in the session, and if not there we redirect to unauthorized again. Assuming it is there,
        the token is appended to the webservice request and this is how github knows we can
        access that rest API call.
    </p>
    <p>
        For simplicity, the results of this call are simply dumped out to the browser as JSON
        text. In a real application you would parse the results into structured data, and likely
        implement many other API calls to navigate around your github repositories. The point is
        that you can use the same oauth-token stored in the session to make those API calls in
        the same way demonstrated here.
